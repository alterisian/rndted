A simple app to get you a random TED.com file.

I have been very impressed with TED for a long time. There's now a vast amount 
of videos available online of these quality talks.

But if you're as indecisive as me, then how do you choose? All of them are a valid choice!
After seeing the massive spreadsheet of all the videos then I felt I wanted to use the data
to do something. Sadly, my tiny brain couldn't get past google's protected spreadsheets to use them as a datasource.
Then I realised I was over complicating it, as they're just id'd.
I'll probably update it to find the latest video at some point, but for now I'll just put in
the maximum video in the sheet today - 25/11/2012.

It is available on heroku at http://rndted.herokuapp.com

Enjoy.

Cheers,
Ian.
